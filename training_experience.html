                    <p>I grew up in the countryside where I learned an appreciation for nature and hard work. 
                        I have now spent most of my working life in the city and am keen to get back somewhere 
                        nearer nature and the countryside which is one of the reasons I now live in Bath.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have gained experience in many areas during my working life, not least in understanding
                         and working with people from different cultures, both in Europe and Asia. Working in Asia
                         was a formative experience becasue often there is not the company support network readily
                         available and I had to rely on my own initiative to find the resources I needed and 
                         drive projects forward.
